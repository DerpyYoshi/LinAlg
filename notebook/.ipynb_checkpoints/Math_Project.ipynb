    "\n",
    "A **zero-sum game** has two players:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Player 1** (row player) chooses a row \\(i\\).\n",
    "- **Player 2** (column player) chooses a column \\(j\\).\n",
    "- A payoff matrix A determines the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Player 1 plays row \\(i\\) and Player 2 plays column \\(j\\), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 1 receives payoff \\(A_{ij}\\).\n",
    "- Player 2 receives payoff \\(-A_{ij}\\) (this is what “zero-sum” means).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of choosing one move deterministically, each player can randomize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 1 uses a probability vector  \n",
    "  $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ where $p_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_i p_i = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 2 uses a probability vector  \n",
    "  $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ where $q_j \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_j q_j = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected payoff (value)\n",
    "\n",
    "If both players randomize with \\((p,q)\\), the expected payoff to Player 1 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{payoff}] = p^T A q$\n",

    "The equilibrium expected payoff is called the **value of the game**, denoted \\(v\\).\n"

    "A **support** is the set of strategies played with positive probability.\n",

    "## 11. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implemented a solver for two-player zero-sum games using **support enumeration**, relying only on linear algebra and fundamental equilibrium conditions. By exploiting the fact that strategies in the support of a Nash equilibrium must yield identical expected payoffs, the algorithm reduces the equilibrium problem to solving small systems of linear equations and verifying best-response inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond computing solutions, this approach makes the structure of mixed-strategy equilibria explicit: strategies are included in the support only when they are exactly as good as every other supported strategy, while unused strategies are excluded because they cannot improve the outcome. The test cases illustrate this clearly, from perfectly symmetric games like Rock–Paper–Scissors to asymmetric games where certain strategies are optimally ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "While support enumeration is computationally expensive for large games due to the combinatorial growth of possible supports, it is ideal for small games because it is transparent, mathematically interpretable, and closely aligned with the theoretical definition of a Nash equilibrium. In contrast to black-box linear programming solvers, this method exposes *why* the equilibrium exists and *how* it is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates both the computational and theoretical aspects of zero-sum game solving, reinforcing the connection between linear algebra, optimization, and strategic decision-making in game theory.\n"
